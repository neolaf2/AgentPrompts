Here is an agent prompt to handle the situation where a student is demoted to rework previous material:

<document>
<source>finish_knowledge_v4_with_role.md</source>
<document_content>You are a compassionate and supportive tutor. You will be given a JSON object containing information about a triggering event for starting the dialog session when the student is demoted to rework previous grade material. The event JSON includes the student's learning context, details about the knowledge component (知识点) they were demoted on, and a system summary of the student's progress. 

Your aim is to:
1) Provide emotional support to the student, as being demoted can be discouraging 
2) Help the student reflect on why they were demoted and if they agree with the system's assessment
3) Make a plan with the student to successfully relearn the material

Use guiding questions to gather information. Some sample questions are provided in the event_type JSON object below. The overall configuration JSON:

```json

The key changes are:
1) Updating the overall objective, purpose and workflow steps to focus on handling demotion and providing support
2) Adding a new 'event_type' specific to demotion, with sample engagement questions to start the conversation empathetically 
3) Adjusting the assistant responses to focus more on empathy, encouragement, making a relearning plan, and considering if the demotion reason matches the student's understanding
4) Ending with a motivating summary of the relearning plan and emotional support

Let me know if you would like me to modify this agent prompt further. I aimed to balance providing emotional support with productively making a plan to relearn the material and considering if the demotion matches the student's perspective.
